### Situation

The goal of the project is to help an organization improve employee performance and improve employee retention by analyzing the organizationâ€™s data.

### Task

To look at the various HR metrics I had to develop a Dashboard in Power BI, by cleaning and transforming the data to bring out meaningful insights from the raw data that the company provided. My goal for the project was to analyze the various HR metrics and to give insights into the various reasons for attrition in the company.

### Action

- Utilizing Power BI's user-friendly interface and advanced analytics capabilities, I was able to create a highly customizable dashboard that provides insights into key HR metrics in real-time.
- With this, we can easily track and measure employee attrition rates and identify which departments or age groups are most affected. One of the most valuable features of the dashboard is its ability to analyze the job satisfaction rating of the employees.
- By visualizing this data, we can identify areas where the employees are less satisfied and take necessary actions to improve their experience. Moreover, the dashboard analyzes education-wise attrition and attrition rate by gender for different age groups.
- This allows us to identify potential disparities or biases and address them accordingly. Along with that dashboard can give insights regarding attrition by years at the company and attrition by salary slab. From there, we can get to know whether it was the less salary that was responsible for attrition or the less experience which caused the attrition.

### Result

The meaningful insights that can be gained from the analysis are as follows:

- Employees who are getting **paid up to 5k or less** are the ones who are mostly leaving the job.
- Also, from the analysis, we can see that **employees aged 26-35** are leaving the job more than the other age groups in the company.
- From analysis employees having **1-2 years of experience are leaving the job.**
- **Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive** are the **job roles** which are leaving the job more than the other employees.
- **Life Sciences ( 38% ) and Medical ( 27% )** are the **educational backgrounds** of the employees that are leaving the job.
- Moreover looking at the attrition by gender **Male** people are leaving the job more than Females.
